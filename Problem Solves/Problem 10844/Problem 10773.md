Consider a number like 45656. It is called a stair number because the absolute difference between every pair of adjacent digits is exactly 1.
Given an integer N, determine how many stair numbers of length N there are. A number is not allowed to start with the digit 0.

---
* Input:

A single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) is given, indicating the length of the stair numbers to count.

---
* Output:

Print a single integer — the count of stair numbers of length N, taken modulo 1,000,000,000.

---
* Example Input/Output:

In:
```

8

```

Out:
```

813

```
