Given a sequence A of N integers, write a program to determine the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence (LIS) within the sequence. A subsequence is obtained by possibly deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

---
* Input:

- The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000), the length of the sequence.

- The second line contains N space-separated integers A₁, A₂, …, Aₙ (each 1≤𝐴𝑖≤1,0001≤Ai​≤1,000).

---
* Output:

- Output a single integer: the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in A.

---
* Example:

In:
```
6
10 20 10 30 20 50
```

Out:
```
4
