### Problem 1904: 01 Tile

Jinho loves to tile with 0s and 1s.
He's thinking about how many ways there are to tile a 1 x N size board using only 1x1 and 1x2 tiles.

For example, for N=4, there are 5 ways to tile:
1. 1, 1, 1, 1
2. 1, 1, 2
3. 1, 2, 1
4. 2, 1, 1
5. 2, 2

Since the number of ways can be very large, find the remainder when the number of ways is divided by 15746.

---
* Input:

The first line contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000), the length of the board.

---
* Output:

Output the remainder when the number of ways is divided by 15746.
