Given N and L, write a program to find the shortest contiguous list of non-negative integers whose sum is N and has a length of at least L.

---
* Input:
  
The first line contains two integers, N and L. N is a natural number less than or equal to 1,000,000,000, and L is a natural number greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 100.

---
* Output:
  
If the length of the list is less than or equal to 100, print the consecutive numbers in the list on the first line, separated by spaces. If the length is greater than 100 or such a sequence does not exist, print -1.

---
* Example Input/Output:

In:
```
18 2
```

Out:
```
5 6 7
```
